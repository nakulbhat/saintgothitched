        <p>Right it's Mrs Ananya now!
            
            Cheers to the coolest teacher turning into a happily-ever-after creature! Remember all those times we tried abbreviating and failed miserably? Well, at least we excelled in appreciating your awesome lessons!
            
            Your sangria-loving, ðŸ˜‡-overusing, and 'No shelf control' ways make you the MVP of our school days! Here's to your new role as the reigning champ of married life.
            
            You've taught us more than just the books. Your lessons on embracing life's quirks and variances stuck with usâ€”especially when note-taking was the absolute worst! (I shall never let that go)
            
            May your marriage be as vibrant as your quirky paint on life's canvas, radiating regal elegance mixed with your unique brand of benevolence. Wishing you a lifetime of sunny love and endless afterglows.
            
            Congratulations, and here's to keeping that tan glowing, no matter where the sun shines!
            
            Big hugs,
            
            Nakul
        </p>
